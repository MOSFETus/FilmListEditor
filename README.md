<h2>FilmListEditor</h2><br>
<p>This small homebrew console application was made to fetch and copy directory names marked with a specific flag and write them into a txt file on a cloudbased storage service in order to allow more users to tinker with that txt file.</p><br>

<h2>UI</h2><br>

<p>Since this is a console app the following commands need to be typed in manually to use their function accordingly.</p><br>
