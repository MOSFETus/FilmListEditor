# FilmListEditor 
\
This small homebrew console application was made to fetch and copy directory names marked with a specific flag and write them into a txt file on a cloudbased storage service in order to allow more users to tinker with that txt file.

## UI  
\
Since this is a console app the following commands need to be typed in manually to use their function accordingly.
> ### **write** 
>> Fetch a list of all subdirectory names (with set flag) from a given local origin directory and write them to given txt file via ***streamwriter***  
>> 
> ### **read** 
>> Fetch a list of all relevant txt file entries via ***streamreader*** create folders in given local origin directory based on the names
>> 
> ### **txt** 
>> Opens given txt file
>> 
> ### **dir** 
>> Opens given local origin directory
>>
> ### **exit**
>> Exits the application
